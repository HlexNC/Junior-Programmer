# Junior-Programmer
In Unity Learn, there is a Pathway called "Junior Programmer" which teaches you the basics of Unity and C#. In this branch, I will be posting most of my Junior Programmer projects.

## Soul dead, but worth it
Yesterday, from 7 pm. to 3 am, I was trying to make a simple basketball game (From a given Project "Counting Prototype"), but I had problems with my PlayerController.cs (It didn't work). I tried to make an FPS basketball game with a 2D view. I gave up on the idea after 5 hours of nonstop work then I reset the project. In bed, I was thinking about how to fix my project. I thought to look on the internet "how to make an FPS Shooter Controller" (Not "Basketball game Unity"). I made a simple FPS basketball game, which I am pretty pleased with.

## Love Unity community!
The task was to "Review and debug the project" I fixed 99%. The 1% was "error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'List<>' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)". Sadly creating a directive reference didn't help, so I asked the Unity Discord community for help. In like 5 min a nice person helped me. There was no "using System.Collections.Generic" reference. I would have never found it by myself.
